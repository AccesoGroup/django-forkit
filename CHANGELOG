	* Forking. Implemented an abstract model class `ForkableModel' which
	supports shallow and deep forking model instances.
	
	* Deferred Commits. All relationships are deferred from being saved until
	the whole hierarchy has been traversed during forking. Forks are not
	committed by default to ensure integrity errors are not forced.

	* Diffs. `ForkableModel' also implements a `diff' method for instances
	that can be used to compare data values against another object of the same
	type.

	* Limitations. `through' models for many-to-many fields are not yet
	supported. Deep diffs are not yet supported.
